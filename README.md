## Forest Simulation Model

This project, created by Team 20, focuses on simulating the forest dynamic systems using  Python and then model a constrained growth ODE to analyse the results from the simulation with real data in Matlab.

How to run the simulation:

1. Download main.py,more_function.py,objects.py and pygame_info.py files locally in the same folder.
2. Run main.py to view the simulation.

How to analyse the ODE and view the results:
1. Run finalcw.m in matlab.
